# Vet_clinic Database

> This project is about creating, editing, delecting, inserting and finding queries of a database about a vet clinic



## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](https://github.com/Stanleeeeee/vet_clinic-Database/blob/development/schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](https://github.com/Stanleeeeee/vet_clinic-Database/blob/development/data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](https://github.com/Stanleeeeee/vet_clinic-Database/blob/development/queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
